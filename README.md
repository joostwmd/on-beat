# ON:BEAT - A Playlist Generator for DJs

Finding good new music on Spotify is hard, but finding the right tracks for your next gig is even harder. Your selections need to have a similar BPM, a fitting mood, and should match the vibe of your setlist. Luckily, Spotify's recommendation system allows you to find music that meets these criteria, but it's accessible only through the API, with no user-friendly interface. That's where **ON:BEAT** comes inâ€”a simple website with an interface that will remind every DJ of their favorite tool: their controller.

## How It Works

1. **Sign in with your Spotify account.**

2. **Set a minimum and maximum BPM.**

3. **Add at least two reference tracks.**

4. **Optionally, set additional filters to narrow down your search.**

5. **Click "Get Recommendations".**

6. **Listen to the previews of the recommended tracks. You can remove songs that you don't like or already know.**

7. **Once satisfied with the recommendations, set a playlist name and description.**

8. **Click "Create Playlist", and you will be redirected to your new playlist once it is created.**

## Run Locally

To run this project locally, you need a Spotify client ID. For guidance on how to obtain one, check out [Spotify's App Settings Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app).

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onbeat.git
